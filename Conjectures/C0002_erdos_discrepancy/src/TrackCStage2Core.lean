# Track C: Stage 2 core lemmas (Tao 2015 plane)

This file is intentionally tiny.

It contains the minimal proved lemmas about `Tao2015.Stage2Output` needed by later stages to
close the global goal `¬ BoundedDiscrepancy f`.

Design note: Track C's hard-gate build for
`Conjectures.C0002_erdos_discrepancy.src.ErdosDiscrepancy`
should not need to compile the full library of Stage-2 convenience lemmas.

/-- Consumer-facing form: Stage 2 implies global unbounded discrepancy for the original sequence.

This is the minimal “bridge back to the main theorem statement” lemma: it packages the fact that
Stage 2 gives unbounded discrepancy along the reduced sequence, and uses the Stage-1 contract
carried by `out.out1` to conclude `¬ BoundedDiscrepancy f`.

theorem notBoundedOriginal (out : Stage2Output f) : ¬ BoundedDiscrepancy f := by

/-- Stage 2 output implies the usual surface statement `∀ C, HasDiscrepancyAtLeast f C`.

This is a thin wrapper around `notBoundedOriginal`.
