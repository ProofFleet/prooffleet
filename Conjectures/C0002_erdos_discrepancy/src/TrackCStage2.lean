# Track C: Stage 2 boundary (Tao 2015 plane)

This module is **Conjectures-only** glue: it introduces a *named stage boundary* for the Tao 2015
Erdős discrepancy proof pipeline.

Design goals:
- Keep the interface small and typed (IO contract, not a pile of lemmas).
- Avoid lemma sprawl: downstream work should prove theorems *about this boundary*, rather than
  repeatedly re-stating the same intermediate reductions.

No statements here are intended for the verified substrate (`MoltResearch/`).

Stage 1 (`ReductionOutput`) packages a shift reduction from the original sign sequence `f` to an
auxiliary sign sequence `g` together with a step size `d`.

Stage 2 (this file) is the next boundary we want to populate: from the Stage-1 reduced sequence,
produce a fixed-step *unboundedness witness form* (`UnboundedDiscrepancyAlong`).

The point of naming this as a record is so later stages can consume it without depending on the
exact internal path used to obtain unboundedness.
-/

/-- Output of Stage 2 of the Track C pipeline.

This is intentionally minimal:
- we keep the full Stage-1 `ReductionOutput` so later stages have access to `g`, `d`, `m`, and the
  bridge contracts;
- we expose the Stage-2 result as *unbounded discrepancy along the fixed step* `d`.

Downstream stages should treat `out1.g` (at step `out1.d`) as the canonical fixed-step locus.

/-- Consumer-facing form: Stage 2 unboundedness transferred back to the original sequence as an
unbounded **offset discrepancy** witness.

This is just a wrapper around
`Tao2015.ReductionOutput.unboundedDiscrepancyAlong_iff_forall_exists_discOffset_gt`.

Note the inequality direction: this produces witnesses of the form `B < discOffset ...`.

/-- Consumer-facing form: Stage 2 implies global unbounded discrepancy for the original sequence.

This is the minimal “bridge back to the main theorem statement” lemma: it packages the fact that
Stage 2 gives an explicit unbounded offset-discrepancy family for `f`, and then uses the Stage-1
contract carried by `out.out1` to conclude `¬ BoundedDiscrepancy f`.

## Stage 2 conjecture stub

The Stage-2 conjecture/axiom stub lives in
`Conjectures.C0002_erdos_discrepancy.src.TrackCStage2Proof` so that this file remains mostly
