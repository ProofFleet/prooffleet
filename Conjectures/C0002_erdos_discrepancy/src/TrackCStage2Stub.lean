# Track C: Stage 2 conjecture stub (Tao 2015 plane)

This file is **Conjectures-only** glue.

It isolates the single non-verified assumption of Track C: the Stage-2 boundary axiom.

Design goal: downstream hard-gate consumers (Stage 3, `ErdosDiscrepancy.lean`) should only need to
import this stub to access `stage2Out`, avoiding compilation of additional Stage-2 convenience
lemmas.

namespace Tao2015

/-- Typeclass packaging of the Stage-2 conjecture assumption.

We package the conjecture as a `Prop` (existence of a Stage-2 output) rather than committing to a
specific function. The definitional output `stage2`/`stage2Out` is then selected noncomputably via
`Classical.choice`.

This lets downstream code replace the axiom stub by providing a local instance (e.g. derived from a
verified Stage-2 construction).

  Stage-1 reduction output and an unbounded fixed-step discrepancy witness along the reduced

/-- Build a `Stage2Assumption` instance from an explicit Stage-2 construction function.

This is a small convenience constructor for downstream developments: a verified Stage-2 algorithm
(or theorem) usually produces a concrete `Stage2Output f`, and this lemma packages it into the
typeclass form expected by the Track-C pipeline.

def ofStage2 (stage2 : ∀ f : ℕ → ℤ, IsSignSequence f → Stage2Output f) : Stage2Assumption :=
  ⟨fun f hf => ⟨stage2 f hf⟩⟩

end Stage2Assumption

/-- Non-typeclass entry point: run Stage 2 using an explicit `Stage2Assumption` proof.

This is useful in downstream developments that want to avoid `letI` / typeclass search and pass a
verified Stage-2 assumption explicitly.

/- Default (Conjectures-only) Stage-2 assumption instance.

This replaces the old `axiom instStage2Assumption` with an explicit construction of a
`Stage2Output`, leaving **exactly one** axiom stub for the mathematical core.

This is the intended “first real problem progress” milestone:
- we now *actually* run a concrete Stage‑1 reduction (`ReductionOutput.ofShift`), and
- we isolate the remaining unverified content to the single Stage‑2 unboundedness witness.

Design note: we register this instance at very low priority so downstream developments can provide
(and override with) a verified `Stage2Assumption` instance.

We keep this as a named definition so later refactors can change the default Stage-1 wiring
without touching the `Stage2Assumption` API.

/-- The single non-verified assumption of Track C (Stage 2 of Tao 2015).

This is stated in terms of the canonical Stage-1 reduction used by `stage2Stub_out1`.
Downstream developments are expected to replace this axiom by providing a verified
`Stage2Assumption` instance.

statement packaged by `Stage2Assumption`.

Note: the implicit `[Stage2Assumption]` argument is intentionally explicit here so that downstream
developments can override the default conjecture instance by providing a local verified instance.

## Definitional rewrites

These tiny lemmas let downstream developments freely switch between the explicit-assumption API
(`stage2OutOf`) and the typeclass-based API (`stage2Out`) by introducing a local instance.

They are deliberately kept in the Stage-2 stub so later stages can import them without pulling in
additional convenience layers.
-/

/-- If we register an explicit assumption `inst` as the local typeclass instance, then the
explicit Stage-2 output `stage2OutOf inst` agrees definitionally with the typeclass-based output
`stage2Out`.

This is useful when consumer code wants to pass `inst` explicitly but also reuse lemmas phrased in
terms of `stage2Out`.
